1) const http = require('http')
    Imports Node.js’s built-in HTTP module, which allows you to create a web server.

2)http.createServer((req, res) => { ... })
    Creates an HTTP server.

3)req → incoming request details

4)res → used to send a response
    This function runs every time a client sends a request to the server.

5)server.listen(PORT, callback)
    Starts the server and makes it listen on a specific port.

6)PORT → the port number (e.g., 3000)

7)callback → optional function that runs after the server starts (commonly used to print “server running…”)

8)Alternative syntax: server.listen(PORT)
    Starts the server without a callback.
    You must manually open the browser and visit localhost:PORT to check it.

9)Purpose of PORT
    Defines where the server will accept incoming connections.
